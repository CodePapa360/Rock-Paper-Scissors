<!-- Brief -->
<p align="center">
Initially built with vanilla TypeScript, the Rock, Paper, Scissors game has now been upgraded to React with TypeScript and Framer Motion. This project reflects my continued focus on mastering TypeScript, beginning in a vanilla JavaScript environment, then evolving into React, and now adding smooth animations with Framer Motion. It's been a great learning experience, sharpening my skills and improving my code quality.

## What I Learned

This project strengthened my understanding of TypeScript, beginning in a vanilla JavaScript environment, continuing with React and TypeScript in v2, and now including animations using Framer Motion in v3. It has helped me improve static typing, code clarity, and enforce safer coding practices, while also adding smooth, interactive animations to enhance the user experience.
